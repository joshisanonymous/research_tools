# This script is meant to do a quality control check on the silences that were
# used in noise_reduction.ps1 to create noise profiles (saved in
# time_stamps_used.csv). It will play each silence, one by one,
# and ask the user to identify whether the silence was acceptable or not and
# to add comments to each one, all of which is saved to a new csv file:
# noise_reduction_qa_results.csv.
