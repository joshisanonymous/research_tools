# This script is meant to automatically apply SoX noise reduction to any number      #
# of audio recordings, specifically those of speech, that are in a single directory. #
# It attempts to skip over all absolute silences and find normal silences from       #
# which to generate noise profiles that can then be used to apply noise reduction.   #
# To adjust settings for silence detection to be more or less conservative, search   #
# for "silencedetect" and modify the values after n= (amplitude ratio for the        #
# threshold) and d= (duration of silence to count as silence). To adjust settings    #
# for how severe the noise reduction should be, search for "noisered" and adjust     #
# the value at the end of the line, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is more        #
# reduction and 0.0 is less.                                                         #
